        "en": "What is Monero?\r\nMonero (XMR) is the top <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=37&view=market\">privacy-centric cryptocurrency</a> based on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote protocol</a>, a secure, private and untraceable currency system. Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.\r\n\r\nOrigins of Monero\r\nIn July of 2012, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin\">Bytecoin</a>, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning \u201ccoin\u201d in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone\u2019s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient\u2019s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone\u2019s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.\r\n\r\nWhat is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote</a>?\r\nCryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. More info about CryptoNote can be found at their <a href=\"https://cryptonote.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. \r\n\r\nCryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable \u2018transaction mixing\u2019 to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users\u2019 funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. \r\n\r\nThe cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction \u2013 not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of \u2018key images\u2019 associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice. \r\n",

In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone\u2019s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient\u2019s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone\u2019s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.\r\n\r\nWhat is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote</a>?\r\nCryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other.

More info about CryptoNote can be found at their <a href=\"https://cryptonote.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. \r\n\r\nCryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable \u2018transaction mixing\u2019 to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users\u2019 funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. \r\n\r\nThe cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction \u2013 not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place. A system of \u2018key images\u2019 associated with each ring signature ensures that although no one can tell the true source of the funds, it can be easily detected if the sender attempts to anonymously send their funds twice. \r\n",

Monero uses a special kind of cryptography to ensure that all of its transactions are  remain 100% unlinkable and untraceable. In an increasingly transparent world, you can see why something like Monero can become so desirable.\r\n\r\nOrigins of Monero\r\nIn July of 2012, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bytecoin\">Bytecoin</a>, the first real life implementation of CryptoNote, was launched. While Bytecoin had promise, people noticed that 80% of the coins were already published. So, it was decided that the bytecoin blockchain will be forked and the new coins in the new chain will be called Bitmonero, which is was then renamed Monero, meaning \u201ccoin\u201d in Esperanto language. In this new blockchain, a block will be mined and added every two minutes.\r\n\r\nWhy Monero?\r\n\r\n#1: Unlinkability - Your identity is completely private\r\n\r\nYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on. When you send funds to someone\u2019s public address, what happens is that you actually send the funds to a randomly created brand new one-time destination address. \r\n\r\nThis means that the public record does not contain any mention that funds were received to the recipient\u2019s public address. In Monero, your public address will never appear in the public record of transactions. Instead, a 'stealth address' is recorded in a way that only you, the recipient, can recognize the incoming funds.\r\n\r\n#2: Fungibility\r\n\r\nFungibility is interchangeability between one asset and another asset of the same type.\r\n\r\nSuppose you borrowed $50 from your friend, you can even return the money in the form of 1 $50 bill or 5 $10 bill, It is still fine. This shows that the dollar has fungible properties. However, if you were to borrow someone\u2019s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.\r\n\r\nWhat is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=Cryptonight\">CryptoNote</a>?\r\nCryptoNote is the application layer protocol that fuels various decentralized currencies. While it is similar to the application layer which runs bitcoin in many aspects, there a lot of areas where the two differ from each other. CryptoNote features an entirely new code base and is not a fork of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a>. More info about CryptoNote can be found at their <a href=\"https://cryptonote.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>. \r\n\r\nCryptoNote uses Ring Signatures to conceal sender identities via mixing and it also has unlinkable transactions that is achieved using 1-time keys for each individual payments. Ring signatures enable \u2018transaction mixing\u2019 to occur. Transaction mixing means that when funds are sent, the sender randomly chooses several other users\u2019 funds to also appear in the transaction as a possible source of the funds being sent. \r\n\r\nThe cryptographical nature of the ring signature means that no one can tell which of the funds were really the source of the transaction \u2013 not even the person that gave the funds to the sender in the first place.
